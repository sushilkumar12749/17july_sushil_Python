#  What are negative indexes and why are they used? 

# Ans :- Negative indexes are a way to count from the end of a list or sequence instead of the beginning. For example, in a list `[10, 20, 30, 40]`, the negative index `-1` refers to the last item (`40`), `-2` refers to the second-to-last item (`30`), and so on.

#They are used to easily access elements from the end of a sequence without needing to know its length. This can be convenient for tasks where you want to work with the last few items.
